        <h1>NLP RESEARCH LAB</h1>
        <p style=" letter-spacing:3px;">Natural language processing (NLP) studies the mathematical and computational modeling of various aspects of N atural languages and devolops a wide range of techniologies and systems to faciliate human-Computer interaction as well as human-human interaction .<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            The last decade has seen a rapid growth in the research and devolopment in the area of Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics in India.We  already has devoloped and deployed some language resourses ,important tools and larger sysytems,such as Machine Translation for some of the major indian languages like Hindi ,Urdu, Ba ngla , Marathi,Punjabi,Tamil,Telugu etc.<br>


            The department of Computer Science & Engineering,IIT(Bhu) was selected by the Mininstry of Communications and Information Technology as a node in the National endeavour on Technology  Devolopment for Indian Languages.In the NLP
             Lab of the department research is focused on various sub-areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) ,Machine Learning and Information Extraction

                <p>Machine learning is closely related to (and often overlaps with) computational statistics, which also focuses on prediction-making through the use of computers. It has strong ties to mathematical optimization, which delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field. Machine learning is sometimes conflated with data mining,[8] where the latter subfield focuses more on exploratory data analysis and is known as unsupervised learning.[5]:vii[9] Machine learning can also be unsupervised[10] and be used to learn and establish baseline behavioral profiles for various entities[11] and then used to find meaningful anomalies.</p>
